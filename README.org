#+TITLE: vc-p4

This package provides VC integration with the Perforce version control system.

This package is quite old and was written for Emacs 23 I think. I'm trying to pull it into the next generation by making it work on Emacs 26.3 at the moment.

* Road to v1

Before I can say that I can release version 1.0.0 of this project, I feel that these features need to be present (this list is subject to change):

- Create new changelists.
- Modify existing changelists.
- Delete existing changelists.
- Move files between changelists.
- View changelist info in =vc-dir=.
- +View repository information in =vc-dir=. (Things like the Client name, current workspace, etc.)+
- +Switch workspaces+.

Some of these features may already be present and working and I just haven't discovered them yet, but until I feel confident that it can be done and is part of my workflow, I'm keeping it on the list.

* Change log

See the [[file:CHANGELOG.org][change log]].

* Switching workspaces

To automatically switch workspaces based on the directory youâ€™re in, make sure that you have the [[https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/P4CONFIG.html][P4CONFIG]] variable set. If this is set, for example to =.p4config=, in any directory that you want to associate with a workspace, add a =.p4config= file and add the following line to it:

#+begin_example
  P4CLIENT=my_client
#+end_example

Where =my_client= is the name of the client you want to use.
