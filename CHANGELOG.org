* 0.2.1 -- 2020-05-27
** FIXED Recognition of sub-directories of Perforce repos

   In other words, on Windows, vc-p4 now correctly recognizes sub-directories as
   part of the repository.

** CHANGED Minimum required Emacs version to 25

** FIXED vc-dir for vc-p4

   =vc-dir= has changed the function that it calls to =vc-BACKEND-dir-status-files=,
   from =vc-BACKEND-dir-status=, so now calling =vc-dir= should work again.
